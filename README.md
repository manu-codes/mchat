# zeix-react-redux-boilerplate

## Features

**_Plop it!_**

We use plop to generate your specific project files. With our handcrafted plop generators you can add React components and saga files. You even can rename or remove them. You only have to worry about your own added dependencies!

**_React_**

Just start using React. It's all set up. 

**_Redux_**

React is only half the fun without Redux and it's amazing store management. With our boilerplate you don't have to worry about Root Reducers and the problem of accessing your store from any component. If you use our plop generators all will be set up.

**_Webpack_**

Grunt and gulp are so 2014. We use webpack too quickly build your files and you can watch it in the browser without any problem.

**_SCSS_**

Write your CSS in amazing SCSS (do we really need to introduce SCSS to you?)

## Getting started

zeix-react-redux-boilerplate is available via npm. So you just have to install it globally on your pc/mac/whateveryouuse

```javascript

```

After this you are ready to start your very own react-redux project. Go to your _projects_ directory, where you want to save the folders for your project.

Enter following command to your command line to setup a project.

```javascript
make-the-web-great-again your-project-name
```

Now you have a proper project directory, with the certified (by ourselves) directory structure. Now go into your project directory and install the dependencies

```javascript
cd your-project-name 
npm install
```

Now you're all setup and you can start transforming coffee into awesome code!

## Webpacking the server

If you want to start the webpack server you just have to enter following command into command line tool:

```javascript
npm run dev
```

Now your most favourite web browser should automatically open the builded web app. That's amazing!
